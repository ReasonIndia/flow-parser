Since the dependencies of flow parser are very likely to cause
package conflicts, we've vendored those dependencies as dune
libraries in this package.
They exist under their original licenses.

## Vendored Libraries:
`ppx_tools_versionedversion` : `5.2` (from [dune universe](https://github.com/dune-universe/dune-universe/tree/9d9472c74792d690886d7cce40c3af7900583c38/packages/ppx_tools_versioned.5.2.3)).
